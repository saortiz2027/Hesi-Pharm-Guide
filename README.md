# Hesi-Pharm-Guide
Hi everyone! I’m Sophia Ortiz, a nursing student in the May 2027 cohort, and I created this site to support our HESI Pharmacology preparation. Here you’ll find organized study resources, direct access to course materials, and key exam details to keep studying focused and manageable. Consistency matters, progress counts, and you are capable.
